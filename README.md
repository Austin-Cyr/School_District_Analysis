# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 Analysis with Pandas, Python


## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The PyCity school board has reviewed the standardized test scores for the district but believes that evidence of academic dishoonesty exists, specifically in the reading and math grades for the Thomas High School 9th graders. In order to uphold state-testing standards, the board has asked to repeat the school district analysis that was already provided and advised how these changes affected the original overall analysis. 

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

### District Summary Impact 

- After removing the 9th graders from Thomas High School, the data shows that the average scores for the district decreases. Thus, the presence of their grades infers that their grades were greater than the district average.
